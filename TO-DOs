---------------------Optimization/Improvement To-Dos---------------------

To-Dos:
0. Incorporate ISLES data into the model.
    c. Add support to choose downsampling vs cropping in generators
1. Add performance metrics in arguments & add patching
    c. Add support for loading 2D shape. Currently hard coded to 3D shape.
    e. Add support for patching both 3D and 2D for testing
    k. Need to make custom_objects when loading model changeable. [Test & Training]

4. Look into super convergence.
5. Check the performance with mixed floating point.
6.
7. Add support for 2D data generator.
8. Add support for 2.5D data generator.
10.
11.
12. Implement k-folds into the structure
13.
14. Squeeze and Excitation Blocks instead of residual connections in V-Net.
15. Thresholding for the post-processing.
16. Try Depthwise convolutions on each axis.


---------------------Done---------------------
-Need to add time / performance stats in the log. [15th-Jan-2024]
-Make loss and metrics configurable. Need to add recall, precision. [15th-Jan-2024]
-Implement learning rate schedular. [12th-Jan-2024]
-Need to make optimizer configurable.[9th-Jan-2024]
-Need to make activation function configurable. [8th-Jan-2024]
-Add train + testing mode. [05-Jan-2024]
-Implement augmentation within the work flow. [12-Dec-2023]
-Need to add normalization & bias correction in getter. [13-Dec-2023]
    -> [Bias Correction should be manually performed, adding it for runtime adds complexity to data type as well
    makes the training process slower as bias correction takes noticeable time.]

-Need to add V-Net model. Check for convergence. [Still not converging]
    [Fixed - 04/Jan/24] - Issue was in activation function of output layer, which was softmax. Softmax is commonly used to
    multiple outputs, hence it was not working well with the loss function which was binary crossentropy.

-Need to add file logging support, log4j etc.
    -> Could look into icecream [Done]
-Some time in the very future, add configuration file rather than command line arguments [Done]
