Nifti3DGenerator:
    1. Need to add normalization & bias correction in getter.
Unet3D:
    1. Need to make activation function configurable.
Train:
    1. Need to make optimizer configurable.
    2. Implement learning rate schedular.
    3. Make loss and metrics configurable.

Required Stuff:
    1. Implement augmentation within the work flow.


---------------------Optimization/Improvement To-Dos---------------------

To-Dos:
0. Need to add dropout in the model.
    a.
    b. Add depthwise seperable convolutions for each network. [No default tensorflow implementation for 3D convolutions https://github.com/alexandrosstergiou/keras-DepthwiseConv3D]
    c. Add support to choose downsampling vs cropping in generators
1. Add performance metrics in arguments & add patching
    1a. Create a separate function for getting performance metrics.
    1b. Also need to change where the getter for the base class is called.
    1c. Add support for loading 2D shape. Currently hard coded to 3D shape.
    1d. Add support for configuring the performance metric (Add support in testing and training)
    1e. Add support for patching both 3D and 2D for testing
    1f. Need to add different normalization method for 2D data.
    1j. Add support for calculating average performance
    1k. Need to make custom_objects when loading model changeable. [Test & Training]

2. Check custom activation usage.
3. Add the train-test and test mode.
    -> Test mode added & 'test'ed. [09-November-2023]
4. Look into super convergence.
5. Check the performance with mixed floating point.
6. Refactor the U-Net model into the current structure.
7. Add support for 2D data generator.
8. Add support for 2.5D data generator.
9. Different augmentation techniques can be implemented alongside cravemix.
10. Move the pre-processing code to a different repository.
11. Need to add file logging support, log4j etc.
    -> Could look into icecream
12. Implement k-folds into the structure
13. Some time in the very future, add configuration file rather than command line arguments
14. Squeeze and Excitation Blocks instead of residual connections in V-Net.
